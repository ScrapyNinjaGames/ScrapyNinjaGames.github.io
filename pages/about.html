    <!--<p>I am a 27 year old Engineering Technician/GIS Specialist for a medium size municipality in the suburbs of Madison, WI. In my free time I enjoy running, cycling, reading, and of course gaming. I have two orange cats named Fennel and Fig. I also have a shepard mix named Bowie. My wife and I were married in October of 2019 and also bought our first house right around that time. I have been interested in programming, and specifically game development since probably high school. I have dabbled with programming throughout the years, but only recently (pandemic) have I really taken the dive. I have a goal of creating my own website (look around), as well as releasing my first game by the end of 2021. Check out my social media links to follow along on my journey! Thank you for visiting!</p>-->
