    <h2>Welcome to Scrapy Ninja Games</h2>
    <p>We are two wannabe indie developers trying to find our way through game development. Our secret headquarters is located in the Madison, WI area. We are eager to learn and get something out for others to play. I hope you enjoy our website and stay tuned for future game development. Thank you for your support.</p>
    
    <!--<p>I am a solo indie developer making games that I am passionate about. I am currently learning the ins and outs of game development while working full-time, going back to school, and spending time with my beautiful wife, two cats (Fennel and Fig), and dog (Bowie). I hope you enjoy my website and stay tuned for future game development. Thank you for your support.</p>-->
